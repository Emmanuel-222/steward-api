# What I Learned
- How to design a relational database schema from scratch — 
  finding the nouns, properties and relationships before writing any code
- The difference between authentication (who are you?) and 
  authorisation (what are you allowed to do?)
- How cron jobs work — building a scheduler that automatically 
  marks stewards absent after the meeting cutoff time
- Why `select` matters in Prisma — never return a password field, 
  even when hashed
- How `include` fetches related table data automatically without writing SQL joins
